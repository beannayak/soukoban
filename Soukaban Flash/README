Sokoban (sokoban, warehouse keeper) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

I've created this game to try and create an algorithm for testing collision detection without actually implimenting collision dectection algorithm.

There are two flash files
	1. Soukaban animated.fla
	2. soukaban.fla
	
In soukaban.fla, users can create and test their own design.

There is an executable file for those who just want to play :).
