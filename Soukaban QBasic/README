Sokoban (sokoban, warehouse keeper) is a type of transport puzzle, in which the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

You may need 'dosbox' in your windows to run qbasic.

I'd created this game while I was in grade 10 to learn about graphics using qbasic. 

There is an executable file for those who just want to play :).
